<h4>About Me</h4>
<div class="about-body">
<img src="images/Face with text.png" alt="Billede af mig">
<p>23 years old and studying to become an AP Graduate in Multimedia Design at Copenhagen Business Academy. Currently living in Lyngby, though I was born and raised in Christianshavn, by two immigrant parents from the Ukraine. My passion is Graphic- and Brand design. I love working on a project for hours on end, exploring multiple possibilities and finding just the right color and design that perfectly fits the idea I have in my mind. I want to learn and explore, to become better and better at what I love. Helping people. Helping people in making their everyday lives just a bit easier. <br> <br> That is why communication is key, in finding the best end product. Communication for me is very important and you will always find me listening and understanding. <br> <br> My other passion is languages. I myself speak 4 (Russian, Danish, English and German) but what I love most is talking with other people and hearing their native language and their story. <br><br><br> <br>
You are probably wondering why I choose the name “Porco Russo” as my pseudonym for my work, and what the name means. I choose the name as an homage to the masterpiece anime film from 1992 “Porco Rosso” directed by Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki. <br> <br>
This is the movie that I have grown up with and me and my family have enjoyed watching through the years. It is one of many films of Miyazaki that has shaped my imagination and broadened my horizon when it comes to creating content. <br><br>
I decided to remember his great film forever and cemented it into my pseudonym but with a slight change. Instead of rosso (red) I wrote russo (Russian). So, my pseudonym translated from Italian is Russian pig. Some may find it offensive but I find it funny and in a way satirical.</p>

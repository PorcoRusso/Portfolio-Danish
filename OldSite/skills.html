      <h4>Skills</h4>
      <div class="under-tekst" >  
        <p>My <b> knowledge </b>is ever growing and i am always   <b>learning</b> but these are just some of the things that i can help you with.</p>

      </div>
  <div class="flex-container">
        <div><h3>Web-design</h3>
          <p>I have excellent experience in <b>designing</b> and <b>structuring</b> websites and creating the perfect product that extendeds the clients ideas and needs. I always work to make the best <b> user friendly interface</b>, that makes the everyday users day, just a bit easier. But as simplicity is important, so is the need to break boundaries and creating something <b>unique</b>. So if you have an idea about wanting a website that says, this is me and my brand, but also tells a story.<b> Porco Russo</b> is the choice for you.  </p></div>
          <div><h3>Graphic- Brand Design</h3>
            <p> Since i was just a child i used to paint everything that came to mind, all <b>shapes and colors</b> . Ideas that grew as the amount of strokes did. And with the years my doodles and paintings were replaced by logos and ideas for designs. I love to <b>experiment</b> with shapes and colors to see what becomes of it. Taking on <b>complex tasks</b>  and working hard until i have succesfully <b>reimagened</b>  your ideas and dreams into a logo and brand.</p></div> 
        <div><h3>Web-development</h3>
          <p>My experience and Skills in the programming languages are growing by the day and so far i have worked with <b> HTML5</b>, <b>CSS3</b> and also dabbled in <b>Javascript</b>. Yes, the design of a website is very <b>important</b>. But so is the <b>program</b> and <b>coding</b> of that website. If the design is the <b> body</b>, the codes are the <b>muscles</b>, <b>veins</b> and <b>organs</b>, the parts that control the body and everything inside. No website is a user friendly website without having a <b>excellent code</b> to support it. </p></div>
          <div><h3>Layot and Marketing</h3>
            <p>There are different ways to <b>advertise</b> and<b> express</b> your brand. I have experience working in that field. <b>Posters</b>, <b>flyers</b>, <b>online-ads</b> and <b>many more</b>. It is important that your brand gets advertised correctly and every little detail can count towards either good or bad. No one likes to watch an unskippable ad on youtube and you instantly dislike the ad. I can help you <b>avoid</b> these kinds of <b> mistakes</b>  and share your brand the right way. Make your ideas <b>stand out</b> and work just the way you want it to. </p></div>
